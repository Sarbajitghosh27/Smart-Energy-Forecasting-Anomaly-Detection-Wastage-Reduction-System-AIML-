# Smart-Energy-Forecasting-Anomaly-Detection-Wastage-Reduction-System-AIML-
An end-to-end ML system for electricity consumption forecasting, anomaly detection, and energy wastage estimation using smart-meter data. The project identifies inefficient usage patterns and recommends corrective actions to reduce excess energy consumption through data-driven insights.
This project presents a complete machine learning pipeline for smart energy analytics using electricity consumption data obtained from smart meters. The objective of the system is not limited to prediction, but extends to understanding abnormal consumption behavior, quantifying energy wastage, and providing actionable insights for energy optimization.

The workflow begins with data preprocessing and feature engineering, where timestamp-based features such as hour and day are extracted along with environmental and historical consumption parameters. Regression models are trained to learn the normal consumption behavior of the system and predict the expected or optimal electricity usage under given conditions. Model performance is evaluated using error-based metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² score to ensure reliability before using the predictions as a baseline.

In parallel, classification models are developed to detect abnormal energy usage events. Special attention is given to class imbalance, as abnormal cases are significantly fewer than normal ones. Class-balanced learning and threshold tuning are applied to analyze the trade-off between precision and recall, emphasizing the importance of recall in anomaly detection scenarios where missed anomalies can have serious consequences.

Energy wastage is quantified by comparing actual electricity consumption with the model-predicted expected consumption. Positive deviations are interpreted as excess energy usage, allowing the system to compute total wastage as well as time-based wastage patterns. This transforms raw consumption data into measurable indicators of inefficiency.

To move beyond analysis, the system incorporates a rule-based decision layer that generates corrective actions for each detected waste event. These actions are derived from usage patterns, time-of-day behavior, historical baselines, and anomaly indicators, resulting in practical recommendations such as off-hour load control, equipment inspection, and alert generation. The overall design emphasizes explainability and decision support, making the project suitable for real-world applications in energy monitoring, smart infrastructure, and sustainability-focused systems.
